## Lab

1. Create a custom visual directive - i.e. no data required - and implement it in multiple places. They can be within the same controller or across multiple controllers. (use this custom directive to display data about the films)
2. Create an attribute directive - i.e. data is passed in through attributes. This doesn't have to use a controller, but can do if you wish.
